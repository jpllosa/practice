once upon a time.
in a land far away.
there lived a jedi knight.
he was alone and angry.
when suddenly, a wolf appeared.
the jedi knight was so frightened.
he turned pale, as white as snow.
then rain clouds gathered over his head.
so, he whipped out his umbrella which 
bought from nijosa.  a high quality 
umbrella.  but a quick brown fox
jumped over the lazy dog-wolf.

and for the sake of issue #2.  we shall mark our commit with fixed #2.
hahaha it ended on column 70.
