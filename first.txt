once upon a time.
in a land far away.
there lived a jedi knight.
he was alone and angry.
when suddenly, a wolf appeared.
the jedi knight was so frightened.
he turned pale. as white as snow.
then rain clouds gathered over his head.
so, he whipped out his umbrella bought
from nijosa.  a high quality umbrella.
