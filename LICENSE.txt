typical enterprise applications are very large:
1.  thousands/millions of lines of code
2.  maintained for a long time (years/decades)
3.  contantly changing (business competition, new technologies)

so... enterprise applications are designed in layers and each
layer with its own responsibility.  the common layers are:
1. Presentation - User Interface/Other Software
2. Service - serves presentation layer
3. Domain - contains business logic
4. Persistence - DAO/Repository/Database
some systems combine layers
